<h2 id="Dataset"> Dataset</h2>
For this project, we use bank marketing dataset from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing) by Moro, Rita, and Cortez (2014).
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking
institution. We access the data in UCI archive directly through the ucimlrepo modules, and
turn it into dataframe
